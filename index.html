    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
        The objective of the game is to eventually eliminate the other player.<br>
        In order to eliminate your opponent, they must fully disappear from the game!<br>
        A player can disappear (and lose) several ways: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Getting hit by projectiles of the opposing color will damage you.</li>
            <li>Every shot you make also does some damage to you, be careful with how fast you fire!</li>
        </ul>
        Players will bounce off of walls and against the middle of the play area.<br>
        Shots will also bounce off of each wall, and when they do they will change color!</br>
        Two shots colliding with eachother will cancel them out and destroy both of them. Shoot defensively!<br>

    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
        This game was done in under 48 hours for the annual Global Game Jam event in Sarasota, Florida on January 20,217 through January 22, 2017.
        The objective of the event was to create any kind of game with a team of people you may meet at
        the Game Jam event based around a given theme. The Jam isn't a competition but instead  a place to
        test yourself, learn new things, and meet new people while creating something together.<br>
        <br>
        <div style="font-size: 3.3vh; text-align: center;">The theme for this year's Game Jam was:<br>
        <img src="theme.jpg" style="width: 25vw; height: auto; border-radius: 15px; margin-top: 1vh;">
        </div>
        <br>
        The original idea for this game was to have players shoot actual waves at eachother, that would then bounce
        off of the walls of the play area and continue to fill up the space indefinitely. <br>
        The objective was to get
        hit by as few waves as possible and survive longer than your opponent, as getting hit with a wave would lower
        your health until you lost. <br>
        This idea eventually evolved into a simpler game, with simpler projectiles that bounced off the walls, and
        exploded into rippling waves when they collided with something else. This would be much easier to program in
        the short time of the event and ensure a finished product in the end.

    <h3>About Global Game Jam</h3>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <span style="font-size: 3vh;">From the Game Jam website:</span><br>
        <div class="quote">
            The Global Game Jam® (GGJ) is the world's largest game jam event (game creation) taking place around the world
            at physical locations. Think of it as a hackathon focused on game development. It is the growth of an idea that
            in today’s heavily connected world, we could come together, be creative, share experiences and express ourselves
            in a multitude of ways using video games – it is very universal. The weekend stirs a global creative buzz in games,
            while at the same time exploring the process of development, be it programming, iterative design, narrative exploration
            or artistic expression. It is all condensed into a 48 hour development cycle. The GGJ encourages people with all kinds
            of backgrounds to participate and contribute to this global spread of game development and creativity.<br>
